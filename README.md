# rs2simlib

Python library for Rising Storm 2: Vietnam physics objects
simulation and automated data collection.

Contains tools for parsing UnrealScript and localization (INI) files
to generate models used in the simulations.

## Development TODOs

- Write better documentation.

- Replace adhoc regex parsing with ANTLR.
    - Good reference using ANTLR: https://github.com/EliotVU/UnrealScript-Language-Service.
